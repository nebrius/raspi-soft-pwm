Raspi SOFT PWM
==============

Raspi Soft PWM is part of the [Raspi.js suite](https://github.com/bryan-m-hughes/raspi) that provides software PWM through [pigpio](https://github.com/fivdi/pigpio).

## Installation

```Shell
npm install raspi-soft-pwm
```

## Example Usage

```JavaScript
var raspi = require('raspi');
var SoftPWM = require('raspi-soft-pwm').SoftPWM;

raspi.init(function() {
  var pwm = new SoftPWM('GPIO17');
  let value = 0;
  setInterval(() => {
    pwm.write(value);
    value++;
    if (value === pwm.range) {
      value = 0;
    }
  }, 10);
});
```

## Pin Naming

The pins on the Raspberry Pi are a little complicated. There are multiple headers on some Raspberry Pis with extra pins, and the pin numbers are not consistent between Raspberry Pi board versions.

To help make it easier, you can specify pins in three ways. The first is to specify the pin by function, e.g. ```'GPIO18'```. The second way is to specify by pin number, which is specified in the form "P[header]-[pin]", e.g. ```'P1-7'```. The final way is specify the [Wiring Pi virtual pin number](http://wiringpi.com/pins/), e.g. ```7```. If you specify a number instead of a string, it is assumed to be a Wiring Pi number.

Be sure to read the [full list of pins](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-io/wiki/Pin-Information) on the supported models of the Raspberry Pi.

## API

### new SoftPWM(config)

Instantiates a new PWM instance on the given pin.

_Arguments_:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Argument</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>config (optional)</td>
    <td>Number | String | Object</td>
    <td>The configuration for the PWM pin. If the config is a number or string, it is assumed to be the pin number for the peripheral. If it is an object, the following properties are supported:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td colspan="2">
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Property</th>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tr>
          <td>pin (optional)</td>
          <td>Number | String</td>
          <td>The pin number or descriptor for the peripheral</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>range (optional)</td>
          <td>Number</td>
          <td>Sets the range register in the PWM peripheral. This value controls how <em>many</em> clock cycles are used in one period. Please refer to the pigpio documentation of [Gpio.pwmRange(range)](https://github.com/fivdi/pigpio/blob/master/doc/gpio.md#pwmrangerange). *Default: 255*</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>frequency (optional)</td>
          <td>Number</td>
          <td>Sets the frequency in the PWM peripheral. Please refer to the pigpio documentation of [Gpio.pwmFrequency(frequency)](https://github.com/fivdi/pigpio/blob/master/doc/gpio.md#pwmfrequencyfrequency). *Default: 800*</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Instance Properties

#### range

A number representing the range initialization value. If a value for `range` was passed to the constructor, it is reflected back here. If no value for `range` was passed to the constructor, then this reflects the default range value, 255.

### Instance Methods

#### write(value)

Sets the duty cycle for the PWM output.

_Arguments_:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Argument</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>value</td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>The duty cycle for the PWM to set, must be between 0 and range</td>
  </tr>
</table>

_Returns_: None

Note: The PWM does not start outputting a signal until write is called for the first time.
